<b>About:</b>
</p>

Battery Lab is a development of:
- <a href="https://github.com/jacktor-stan/BNotifier">BNotifier</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/Ph03niX-X/CapacityInfo">Capacity Info</a>

---

Battery Lab rarely updates because we are busy IRL.

Currently the kernel/experiment feature is still in beta and may not work on some devices.

Then the Power Connection feature is based on the BNotifier feature and has not been fully tested.

Please contact us by email at support@jacktor.com if you have any questions.
